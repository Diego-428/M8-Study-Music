# Diego's Groovy LoFi Beat

## How to Run
This program can only be run in the [Sonic Pi software](https://sonic-pi.net/). After downloading the software, copy and paste the code into the groovy_beat.rb file, to the editor in Sonic Pi, press the run button, and enjoy!

## Description
This program is heavily inspired by the LoFi beat videos on YouTube which help me concentrate when I'm studying. Since the objective of this project is to make a relaxing video & audio, I figured I'd help others in a similar way that the LoFi videos did to me. I tried to imitate the setting in the image provided below, though I did appreciate some of the differences seen in my video. For example, I had just learned how to crochet, so I spent the entire video doing that. I also set a 'fireplace' in the background and to the intended ambiance.
